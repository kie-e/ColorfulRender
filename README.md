# ColorfulRender
**ColorfulRender.h** is a simple header that allows you to emulate 10-bit depth by Frame Rate Control in your SFML applications. This library contains several classes to start working with FRC technology easily.


**converter.py** allows you to convert 16-bit image into 8-bit and 2-bit images which could be used by Colorful Rendering to recreate 10-bit color accuracy.


* Note: converter.py requires pygame & cv2 to be installed.


  > pip install pygame


  > pip install opencv-python


_In example/ folder you can find an example source code and Win x64 executable._
